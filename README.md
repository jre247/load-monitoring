# load-monitoring
About:

This is a web application that will monitor the load uptime of the machine that the web application is running on.


Installation steps:

Run the following commands in the Terminal if you're on a Mac or in the Command Prompt if you're on Windows in the root directory of this application:

1) Run "npm install"
2) Run "bower install"
3) Run "gulp"
4) Run "npm run start" (it's easier to run this in a separate terminal/cmd window, but not necessary)
